# 🛡️ Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take security seriously. If you discover a vulnerability in **ChecKMarK Upkeep Docs Action**, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Do not report security issues through public GitHub issues.**  

Instead, email:
**[human@checkmarkdevtools.dev](mailto:human@checkmarkdevtools.dev)**

Please include:

- **Description** – Clear explanation of the vulnerability
- **Impact** – What could an attacker gain
- **Reproduction** – Step-by-step reproduction details
- **Affected Versions** – Which versions are impacted
- **Suggested Fix** – Optional ideas for remediation

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment** – You’ll get a reply once I see your email (usually within 48 hours).
2. **Initial Assessment** – Expect an update within 5 business days after acknowledgment.
3. **Ongoing Updates** – I’ll keep you in the loop as the investigation progresses.
4. **Resolution** – Critical issues are prioritized for immediate fixes.
5. **Disclosure** – Responsible disclosure timing will be coordinated with you.

### Security Measures

Upkeep Docs includes several built-in safeguards:

- **Input Validation** – All inputs are sanitized and validated.
- **Token Security** – GitHub tokens are handled securely and never logged.
- **Minimal Permissions** – Requests only what’s necessary.
- **Dependency Scanning** – Regular automated dependency scans.
- **Static Code Analysis** – Continuous scanning for vulnerabilities.
- **Secure Defaults** – Configurations start secure by design.

### Best Practices for Users

To stay secure:

1. Use tokens with minimal required permissions.
2. Limit repository access to those needing documentation updates.
3. Always review PRs generated by Upkeep Docs before merging.
4. Keep your workflows and actions up to date.
